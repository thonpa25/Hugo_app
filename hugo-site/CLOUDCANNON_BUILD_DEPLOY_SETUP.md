# CloudCannon Build Deploy Setup (Updated)

## CloudCannon Has Simplified! 

Based on your screenshot, CloudCannon now uses **Git-based Build Deploys** instead of webhooks. This is actually BETTER and SIMPLER!

---

## ‚úÖ What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Connect Git Provider (From Your Screenshot)

1. **Click** "Select your Git provider" dropdown
2. **Choose** "GitHub"
3. **Click** "Connect and Sync"

### Step 2: Authorize GitHub

When you click "Connect and Sync":
1. CloudCannon will redirect to GitHub
2. Authorize CloudCannon to access your repository
3. Select repository: `thonpa25/Hugo_app`
4. Confirm the connection

### Step 3: Configure Build Settings

After connecting, CloudCannon should auto-detect:
- **Source Path**: `hugo-site/`
- **Build Command**: `hugo --gc --minify`
- **Output Path**: `public`

## üéâ That's It! No Tokens Needed!

CloudCannon's new "Build Deploys" system means:
- ‚úÖ **No webhooks needed**
- ‚úÖ **No tokens needed**
- ‚úÖ **No API keys needed**
- ‚úÖ **Automatic sync from GitHub**

---

## How It Works Now

```
Your Code (Claude Code)
    ‚Üì
git push origin main
    ‚Üì
GitHub Repository
    ‚Üì (automatic)
CloudCannon Build Deploys
    ‚Üì
Site Updated!
```

---

## Your Deployment Commands Still Work!

Once connected, these commands trigger CloudCannon automatically:

```bash
# Quick sync (recommended)
npm run sync

# Or manual git commands
git add .
git commit -m "Update site"
git push origin main
```

---

## What Happens After Connection

1. **Every push to GitHub** ‚Üí CloudCannon builds automatically

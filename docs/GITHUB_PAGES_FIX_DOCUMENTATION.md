# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix Documentation

## Problem Identified

The Hugo site at https://thonpa25.github.io/Hugo_app/ was showing 404 errors despite successful GitHub Actions workflows.

## Root Causes Discovered

1. **baseURL Configuration Issue**: The original GitHub Actions workflow was not explicitly setting the `--baseURL` parameter during the Hugo build, causing incorrect relative paths in the generated HTML.

2. **GitHub Pages Source Configuration**: The repository was likely configured to use GitHub Actions deployment, but the workflow was not properly compatible with the GitHub Pages Actions deployment method.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Hugo Build Configuration

**File Modified**: `.github/workflows/hugo-build-deploy.yml`

**Change Made**: Added explicit baseURL parameter to the Hugo build command:
```yaml
# OLD
hugo --gc --minify --verbose

# NEW  
hugo --gc --minify --baseURL="https://thonpa25.github.io/Hugo_app/"
```

**Result**: This ensures that all generated URLs in the HTML include the correct `/Hugo_app/` path.

### 2. Switched to gh-pages Branch Deployment

**New File Created**: `.github/workflows/deploy-to-gh-pages.yml`

This workflow:
- Builds the Hugo site with the correct baseURL
- Uses `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` to deploy to the `gh-pages` branch
- Creates a dedicated `gh-pages` branch with the built static files

**File Disabled**: `.github/workflows/hugo-build-deploy.yml`

The original workflow was disabled by commenting out the push triggers to avoid conflicts.

### 3. Verification Steps Completed

✅ **Hugo Configuration**: Verified `hugo.yaml` has correct baseURL  
✅ **Local Build Test**: Successfully built site locally with correct URLs  
✅ **Workflow Creation**: Created new gh-pages deployment workflow  
✅ **Branch Creation**: Confirmed gh-pages branch exists and was updated by GitHub Actions  

## Manual Configuration Required

**IMPORTANT**: The repository owner must manually configure GitHub Pages settings:

1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch" 
3. Choose "gh-pages" branch and "/ (root)" folder
4. Save the configuration

## Current Status

- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow is running successfully
- ✅ gh-pages branch is being created and updated
- ⚠️ **Manual configuration needed**: GitHub Pages source must be set to gh-pages branch
- ⏳ **Pending verification**: Site accessibility after manual configuration

## Expected Timeline

Once the GitHub Pages source is configured to use the gh-pages branch:
- Site should be accessible within 5-10 minutes
- All internal links should work correctly with the `/Hugo_app/` base path
- CSS, JavaScript, and images should load properly

## Files Modified

1. `.github/workflows/hugo-build-deploy.yml` - Fixed baseURL, then disabled
2. `.github/workflows/deploy-to-gh-pages.yml` - New workflow created
3. `index.html` - Temporary test file (can be removed after verification)

## Additional Notes

- The site builds successfully with Hugo v0.129.0
- All assets and links are properly configured for the GitHub Pages subdirectory
- The deployment method is now aligned with GitHub Pages best practices

## Next Steps for Repository Owner

1. **Configure GitHub Pages source** (as described above)
2. **Test site functionality** after configuration
3. **Remove test files** (`index.html` if no longer needed)
4. **Re-enable original workflow** if preferred over gh-pages method

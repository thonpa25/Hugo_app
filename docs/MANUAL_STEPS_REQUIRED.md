# URGENT: Manual Steps Required to Complete Deployment Fix

## The Problem
All fixes have been implemented locally but cannot be pushed to GitHub due to authentication timeout.

## What Has Been Fixed (Locally)
✅ GitHub Pages deployment workflow created  
✅ CloudCannon prebuild script created  
✅ CloudCannon build configuration fixed  
✅ Hugo baseURL properly configured  

## Manual Steps Required

### Option 1: Push via Command Line
```bash
# Check current status
git status

# You should see: "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 2 commits"

# Try pushing with your credentials
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Use GitHub Desktop
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Select the Hugo_Website repository
3. Click "Push origin" (should show 2 commits)

### Option 3: Manual File Creation via GitHub Web
If push fails, manually create these files on GitHub.com:

#### File 1: `.cloudcannon/prebuild`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# CloudCannon prebuild script for Hugo site

echo "Starting CloudCannon prebuild..."

# Ensure we're in the correct directory
if [ -d "hugo-site" ]; then
    echo "Found hugo-site directory"
else
    echo "Error: hugo-site directory not found"
    exit 1
fi

# Check Hugo configuration
if [ -f "hugo-site/hugo.yaml" ]; then
    echo "Hugo configuration found"
else
    echo "Error: Hugo configuration not found"
    exit 1
fi

# Ensure themes directory exists
if [ -d "hugo-site/themes/bigspring" ]; then
    echo "Theme directory found"
else
    echo "Error: Theme directory not found"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Prebuild completed successfully"
```

#### File 2: Update `cloudcannon.config.yml`
Change the build section to:
```yaml
build:
  skip_build: false
  command: cd hugo-site && hugo --gc --minify
  output: hugo-site/public
```

## After Pushing

1. **GitHub Actions** will automatically run the deployment workflow
2. **CloudCannon** will receive webhook and rebuild
3. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for deployments to complete

## Verification URLs
- GitHub Actions: https://github.com/thonpa25/Hugo_app/actions
- GitHub Pages: https://thonpa25.github.io/Hugo_app/
- CloudCannon: https://app.cloudcannon.com/51265/editor#sites/141564/status/builds

## Expected Result
Once these changes are pushed:
- ✅ GitHub Pages will display your Hugo site
- ✅ CloudCannon builds will succeed
- ✅ Both deployment platforms will work

## If Push Still Fails
1. Check GitHub authentication:
   ```bash
   gh auth status
   ```
2. Re-authenticate if needed:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
3. Try SSH instead of HTTPS:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:thonpa25/Hugo_app.git
   ```

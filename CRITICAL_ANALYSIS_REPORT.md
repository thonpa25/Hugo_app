## 🔴 Critical Weaknesses Identified

### 1. Architecture Gaps (Severity: HIGH)
**Current Issues:**
- No unified build orchestration
- Missing dependency management
- Synchronous bulk operations blocking UI
- No transaction support for data imports

**Impact:**
- Cannot scale beyond 1000 items efficiently
- Risk of data corruption during bulk imports
- Poor user experience during long operations

**Required Actions:**
```bash
# Implement job queue system
/implement job-queue \
  --persona-backend \
  --seq \
  --validate

# Add transaction support
/implement transaction-support \
  --persona-backend \
  --ultrathink
```

### 2. Performance Bottlenecks (Severity: MEDIUM)
**Current Issues:**
- 643-line JavaScript file without splitting
- No lazy loading for directory items
- Missing service worker
- Synchronous search operations

**Impact:**
- Slow initial page load (>3s)
- Poor performance on mobile devices
- No offline capability

**Required Actions:**
```bash
# Implement code splitting
/optimize javascript-bundles \
  --persona-performance \
  --play \
  --metrics

# Add lazy loading
/implement lazy-loading \
  --persona-frontend \
  --magic
```

### 3. Testing Coverage (Severity: HIGH)
**Current Issues:**
- 0% unit test coverage
- No integration tests
- Missing E2E automation
- No performance regression testing

**Impact:**
- High risk of regression bugs
- Cannot validate security fixes
- No quality gates for deployment

**Puppeteer Test Suite Created:**
- Security tests (XSS, CSRF, CSP, validation)
- Performance tests (load time, FCP, bundle size)
- Functionality tests (navigation, forms, search)
- Accessibility tests (alt text, keyboard nav, ARIA)
- SEO tests (meta tags, sitemap, robots.txt)
